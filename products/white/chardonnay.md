*Chardonnay* is a very versatile grape whose character reflects its growing region and production process. Of all the white wine types, Chardonnay produces the most complex wines in the world. Most chardonnays are full, golden and velvety with hints of fruit, nuts, butter, oak, spice or vanilla and have medium to high acidity.
